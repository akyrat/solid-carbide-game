## Description

Build Drifting, Decisions, "Bouncier Bouncy Bumpers". Raise the Bouncy Bumpers factors (today x1.4 / 1.8 / 2.2 / 2.6 in data, of which the run now uses 2 tiers) so the bounce is clearly further at every tier; propose the numbers (for example about 1.5 times today's) and check the farthest bounce doesn't throw the car through thin walls or off the map. Data only, unless the cap on the hardest bounce also needs raising (then say so). If the card text names a number, list it in the result notes: the Project Lead gets new text from the Narrative Theme Agent.

The board's review: play the combined build from C:\solid-carbide-worktrees\playtest-batch-1105\game\project.godot before merging.

Never write, move or commit anything in game/data/levels/ (the board's own levels). SFX stay off. Write result notes with `python C:/solid-carbide-game/tools/task_notes.py T-NNN --text "..."` (your ticket's id) and hand back in one short line (tasks/README.md, "Handing back"). Every number you choose is a proposal for the board's playtest: list each with its reason in the result notes and keep it in data where the code already reads data.

## Acceptance criteria

Written by the Project Lead. Each one must be something the QA/Integration Agent can realistically verify. QA writes a pass or fail next to each.

- [ ] The factors in data are higher at every tier, and the bounce distance test measures the new distances (test). (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] The result notes give the old and new distances per tier, and say whether any player-facing text names a number. (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] docs/drifting.md Content gives the new numbers. (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] The tests for the changed code pass (the agent) and QA's full run passes, with the counts in the result notes. (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] A plot in art-archive/T-540/screenshots/ shows old and new bounce distance per tier. (QA: pass / fail)

## Updates

The Project Lead's replies to the board on this ticket, newest last, one entry per lane change. Written only through `task_status.py --reply`; leave it empty here.

## Style review

Only for art and text tasks: one entry per round of the style loop (`tasks/README.md`, "The style loop"), written by the loop's tool.

## Result notes

Written by the agent when it finishes.
