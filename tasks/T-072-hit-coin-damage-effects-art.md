## Description

**Blocked until T-044 (minions and coins) and T-036 (the run, where the car takes damage) are done.**

Effects from Visual style, Decisions: an enemy being hit, an enemy dying, the coins enemies drop, and the car taking damage. Hook each to the moment it belongs to (T-044's hit, death and coin drop, the run's damage function) and swap in for any placeholders.

Follow Visual style, Decisions: pixel art for the isometric view at about 40 pixels per unit, a selective dark outline, detailed shading, about 30 colours per sprite, glow drawn into the pixels (no engine bloom), no anti-aliasing, no semi-transparent pixels, a transparent background, and the night neon palette. Real-world things are inspiration only: no real logos, no copies of existing characters. Details the docs leave open (directions, frame counts, variants, sizes) are this agent's proposal, written in the result notes for the board to judge (Visual style, Decisions).

Use the existing client, `game/tools/pixellab_client.py`. Record every call with its prompt, settings and cost, and the balance before and after. One round of generation only: don't regenerate; report problems instead. The board judges the result.

This art task swaps its art in for the placeholder itself (`tasks/README.md`, "Art replaces placeholders"), without changing how the game behaves.

Work on your own branch and folder, as `tasks/README.md` ("Git branches") describes.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A check script shows every new sprite has a transparent background, no semi-transparent pixels, and about 30 colours or fewer (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] The record lists every PixelLab call with its prompt, settings and cost, and the balance before and after; only one round of generation was made (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] A screenshot sequence shows a minion being hit, dying and dropping a coin, and the car taking damage (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] T-044's and T-036's tests still pass (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] The full GUT suite and all Python tool tests pass (QA: pass / fail)

The board's review: judge the look. One round only, so problems are reported rather than regenerated.

## Result notes

Written by the agent when it finishes.
