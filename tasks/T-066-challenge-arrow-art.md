## Description

**Moved after the MVP (2026-10-11): challenges are left out of the MVP (Level design, Decisions). Not to be started unless the board brings challenges back.**

**Blocked until T-019 (the preset challenges) and T-035 (the meteor challenges) are done.**

The challenge arrow, as Visual style, Decisions describes it: a glowing arrow painted on the ground along the challenge's 3-unit corridor. Blue for the map's challenges, green for the kaiju's meteor challenges (the same green as the kaiju's shield). Make the pieces the corridor is drawn from (straight and curved band pieces, the arrowhead) in both colours, plus any frames the drawing-itself and pulsing animation needs, and swap them in for the placeholder bands. The animation itself is T-067.

Follow Visual style, Decisions: pixel art for the isometric view at about 40 pixels per unit, a selective dark outline, detailed shading, about 30 colours per sprite, glow drawn into the pixels (no engine bloom), no anti-aliasing, no semi-transparent pixels, a transparent background, and the night neon palette. Real-world things are inspiration only: no real logos, no copies of existing characters. Details the docs leave open (directions, frame counts, variants, sizes) are this agent's proposal, written in the result notes for the board to judge (Visual style, Decisions).

Use the existing client, `game/tools/pixellab_client.py`. Record every call with its prompt, settings and cost, and the balance before and after. One round of generation only: don't regenerate; report problems instead. The board judges the result.

This art task swaps its art in for the placeholder itself (`tasks/README.md`, "Art replaces placeholders"), without changing how the game behaves.

Work on your own branch and folder, as `tasks/README.md` ("Git branches") describes.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A check script shows every new sprite has a transparent background, no semi-transparent pixels, and about 30 colours or fewer (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] The record lists every PixelLab call with its prompt, settings and cost, and the balance before and after; only one round of generation was made (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] A screenshot shows a preset challenge with the blue arrow and a meteor challenge with the green one (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] T-019's and T-035's tests still pass (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] The full GUT suite and all Python tool tests pass (QA: pass / fail)

The board's review: judge the look. One round only, so problems are reported rather than regenerated.

## Result notes

Written by the agent when it finishes.
