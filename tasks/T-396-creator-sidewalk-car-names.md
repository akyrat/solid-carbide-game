## Description

Write the side panel's names for the new pieces, in the same voice and length as the existing ones (Level design, Content, "Level creator text"): the sidewalk (under Ground), the parked car and the broken car (under Obstacles), and, if T-398 shows them, the strip's labels for the car's look (which model) and its facing. Write them in Level design, Content, "Level creator text", where T-398 copies them into `creator_texts.json`. Run them through the style loop.

The board's decision (Level design, Decisions, "Sidewalks and parked cars in the level creator", 2026-10-30). The board: "add sidewalk assets that fit with the road ... and the buildings and other assets that we have, and make sure that it works well, consider the curb as well. And I also want a few different car assets that are just sitting parked, just normal, boring kind of cars. Generate some broken ones as well. And make it so that they sit at four rotations: top right, bottom right, bottom left, top left. This is for the level creator." The board's answers: parked cars are solid obstacles like boulders (crash into them, pairable for thread the needle); sidewalks are painted like roads with the curb added automatically where they meet a road, and the car drives up over the curb; PixelLab up to 50 generations for the whole set (T-397 and T-399 together), sample first. The tickets: T-396 (piece names), T-397 (art sample), T-398 (the pieces in the creator and the run, placeholders), T-399 (the full art set, swapped in). The board's levels are in the main checkout's `C:\solid-carbide-game\game\data\levels\` (untracked): read copies only, never write or commit them.

## Acceptance criteria

Written by the Project Lead. Each one must be something the QA/Integration Agent can realistically verify. QA writes a pass or fail next to each.

- [ ] Level design, Content, "Level creator text" lists the names for the sidewalk, the parked car and the broken car, with where each appears. (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] Each name went through the style loop, with its score in the Style review. (QA: pass / fail)

## Updates

The Project Lead's replies to the board on this ticket, newest last, one entry per lane change. Written only through `task_status.py --reply`; leave it empty here.

## Style review

Only for art and text tasks: one entry per round of the style loop (`tasks/README.md`, "The style loop"), written by the loop's tool.

## Result notes

Written by the agent when it finishes.
