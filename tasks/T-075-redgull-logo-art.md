## Description

Redgull's logo, as Visual style, Decisions describes it: a simple, sketched seagull with red eyes, slightly evil and unsettling on purpose (Extended narrative, Decisions). It is a fictional brand: it must not look like any real brand's logo. Deliver it as an image with a transparent background, at a few sizes (for example 32, 64 and 128 pixels wide). Where it appears in the MVP is decided separately; this task only makes the logo, so there is no placeholder to swap.

Follow Visual style, Decisions: pixel art for the isometric view at about 40 pixels per unit, a selective dark outline, detailed shading, about 30 colours per sprite, glow drawn into the pixels (no engine bloom), no anti-aliasing, no semi-transparent pixels, a transparent background, and the night neon palette. Real-world things are inspiration only: no real logos, no copies of existing characters. Details the docs leave open (directions, frame counts, variants, sizes) are this agent's proposal, written in the result notes for the board to judge (Visual style, Decisions).

Use the existing client, `game/tools/pixellab_client.py`. Record every call with its prompt, settings and cost, and the balance before and after. One round of generation only: don't regenerate; report problems instead. The board judges the result.

This art task swaps its art in for the placeholder itself (`tasks/README.md`, "Art replaces placeholders"), without changing how the game behaves.

Work on your own branch and folder, as `tasks/README.md` ("Git branches") describes.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A check script shows every new sprite has a transparent background, no semi-transparent pixels, and about 30 colours or fewer (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] The record lists every PixelLab call with its prompt, settings and cost, and the balance before and after; only one round of generation was made (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] The logo exists at the sizes listed in the result notes, and Godot imports it (QA: pass / fail)
- [ ] The full GUT suite and all Python tool tests pass (QA: pass / fail)

The board's review: judge the look. One round only, so problems are reported rather than regenerated.

## Result notes

Written by the agent when it finishes.
