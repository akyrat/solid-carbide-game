# Timeline

A record of everything done for the game, at least everything the board told the Project Lead. Maintained by the Project Lead. Each entry lists the documents the decision touched and the tasks it produced.

Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD: short title
- Decision or change:
- Documents touched:
- Tasks: (task ids)
```

## 2026-10-03: Agent team defined
- Decision or change: defined all eleven agent roles, their relationships, the common rules for every agent, and the workflow for task files and QA. Recorded game details so far in the documents.
- Documents touched: all the separate documents in `docs/`
- Tasks: none yet

## 2026-10-04: Project setup assigned, Freesound chosen
- Decision or change: QA/Integration owns the technical setup every code agent needs (Godot 4.6.2 project, headless runner, test suite, screenshot script, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`). The SFX Agent will source sound effects from Freesound through its API; the board has created an account. API keys live in a git-ignored `.env` at the repo root.
- Documents touched: none yet (T-001 updates `game/README.md`)
- Tasks: T-001

## 2026-10-04: Freesound credentials and SFX test run
- Decision or change: the SFX Agent downloads original Freesound files through OAuth2, using the board's Client id, Client secret/Api key and redirect URL kept in `.env`; tokens are kept in a git-ignored `.secrets/` folder. A test run downloads 3 engine idle and 3 tire drift sounds to prove the pipeline. Which licenses the game accepts (in particular non-commercial ones) is an open decision for the board, to be made when reviewing T-002. T-001 now also covers the extra variables and `.secrets/`.
- Documents touched: `README.md`
- Tasks: T-001 (updated), T-002

## 2026-10-04: PixelLab test run
- Decision or change: the Asset Generation Agent uses the PixelLab v2 API with the board's API token kept in `.env`. A test run generates 1 isometric road tile and 1 still car image with generic descriptions, using the cheapest endpoints, to prove the pipeline and the asset record before the Visual style document is written. No style decision is made.
- Documents touched: `README.md`
- Tasks: T-003
