# Timeline

A record of everything done for the game, at least everything the board told the Project Lead. Maintained by the Project Lead. Each entry lists the documents the decision touched and the tasks it produced.

Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD: short title
- Decision or change:
- Documents touched:
- Tasks: (task ids)
```

## 2026-10-03: Agent team defined
- Decision or change: defined all eleven agent roles, their relationships, the common rules for every agent, and the workflow for task files and QA. Recorded game details so far in the documents.
- Documents touched: all the separate documents in `docs/`
- Tasks: none yet

## 2026-10-04: Project setup assigned, Freesound chosen
- Decision or change: QA/Integration owns the technical setup every code agent needs (Godot 4.6.2 project, headless runner, test suite, screenshot script, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`). The SFX Agent will source sound effects from Freesound through its API; the board has created an account. API keys live in a git-ignored `.env` at the repo root.
- Documents touched: none yet (T-001 updates `game/README.md`)
- Tasks: T-001

## 2026-10-04: Freesound credentials and SFX test run
- Decision or change: the SFX Agent downloads original Freesound files through OAuth2, using the board's Client id, Client secret/Api key and redirect URL kept in `.env`; tokens are kept in a git-ignored `.secrets/` folder. A test run downloads 3 engine idle and 3 tire drift sounds to prove the pipeline. Which licenses the game accepts (in particular non-commercial ones) is an open decision for the board, to be made when reviewing T-002. T-001 now also covers the extra variables and `.secrets/`.
- Documents touched: `README.md`
- Tasks: T-001 (updated), T-002

## 2026-10-04: PixelLab test run
- Decision or change: the Asset Generation Agent uses the PixelLab v2 API with the board's API token kept in `.env`. A test run generates 1 isometric road tile and 1 still car image with generic descriptions, using the cheapest endpoints, to prove the pipeline and the asset record before the Visual style document is written. No style decision is made.
- Documents touched: `README.md`
- Tasks: T-003

## 2026-10-04: T-001 done: Godot project and test suite in place
- Decision or change: the Godot 4.6.2 project, headless test runner (GUT 9.6.1), screenshot tool, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` and `.env.example` are in place. T-001 passed QA round 1 on all 10 criteria, and the board confirmed the project opens correctly in the Godot editor. T-002 and T-003 are no longer blocked by it.
- Documents touched: `README.md`, `game/README.md`
- Tasks: T-001

## 2026-10-04: Task status rules and required reading
- Decision or change: when a task becomes `done`, tasks whose dependencies are now all `done` move from `blocked` to `open` in the same commit. Every agent reads `tasks/README.md` before starting any task, and every task file lists it first in `files_to_read_first`. `CLAUDE.md` is unchanged.
- Documents touched: `tasks/README.md`, `tasks/_TEMPLATE.md`
- Tasks: T-002, T-003 (`files_to_read_first` updated)

## 2026-10-04: Freesound redirect URI dropped
- Decision or change: the board has no redirect URI for its Freesound credentials, so none is used. The Freesound login link carries only the client id, Freesound shows the code on its own page, and `FREESOUND_REDIRECT_URI` is removed from `.env.example` and the README.
- Documents touched: `README.md`
- Tasks: T-002 (login step updated)
