# Checking audio imports

(From the old `game/README.md`; the index is [../../README.md](../../README.md).)

## Checking audio imports

Checks that every `.wav`, `.ogg` and `.mp3` under a folder was imported by Godot and loads as a non-empty AudioStream. Runs headless and imports the project first.

**Git Bash:**

```
bash game/tools/check_audio.sh [res://folder]
```

**PowerShell:**

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File game/tools/check_audio.ps1 [res://folder]
```

The folder defaults to `res://audio`. It prints one `OK` or `FAIL` line per file. Exit codes: 0 = all load; 1 = bad arguments or no audio files found; 2 = at least one file failed.
